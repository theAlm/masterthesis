Abstract

Motivated by the weakly electric fish’s electro-sensing skill set we examine  the  anisotropic  transmission  problem  to  identify  targets  with anisotropic conductivity profile based on anisotropic polarization tensors. To that features of anisotropic polarization tensors and anisotropic layer potentials are shown and invariants are derived.  Moreover, common properties of the isotropic and anisotropic single and double layerpotential are stated among a spectral decomposition of the anisotropic Neumann-Poincaré operator. Finally  a  target  identification  and  location  procedure  for  three-dimensional  extended  targets  based  on  first and second order anisotropic polarization tensors is given.
